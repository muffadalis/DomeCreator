# 3D LEGO Dome Creator

I have used this application as a way to learn more about WPF, 3D and the famed MVVM. This application is understanding for MVVM and WPF implementation should be done. I am open to your comments and ways to improve this application. Since this application uses only one part, all the required files are places in the “Parts” folder. If you want to use the LDraw parts library, you will need to download it from here and the place the path in the App.Config. Also ldconfig.ldr, which a part of LDraw, needs to placed in the application path as it has all the details about the part colors.

The application itself is very simple to use. Choose the type of dome that you would like to build, set the various parameters like the diameter and the height of the dome, the height is consider only when the dome type is not spherical. You can change the color of the dome by clicking on the color palette.
